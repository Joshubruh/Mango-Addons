# How to Use

First, install dependencies.  For windows, open your command prompt as admin and cd into the directory [EXAMPLE: 'cd C:/Users/yourName/Downloads/MangoAddons].  Then, run "pip install -r requirements.txt".  This will download all of the libraries needed to run the code

Secondly, launch your desired module by running "python3 <modName>", fill out the CLI [Start with buy/sell order, what item to flip, etc], the bot will then give you five seconds to navigate to your minecraft window, and will start executing the commands
